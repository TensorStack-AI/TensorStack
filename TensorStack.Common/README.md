# TensorStack.Common
`TensorStack.Common` is the core library that contains shared functionality used across TensorStack projects. 
It includes the fundamental tensor types (ImageTensor, VideoTensor, AudioTensor) and base pipeline logic. 
It also provides utilities for managing ONNX sessions and models, handling automatic input type conversions, and simplifying the creation, use, and disposal of OrtValue objects.
